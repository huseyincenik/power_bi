## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. It helps users gain insights into various key metrics such as total casualties, accidents, and the breakdown of casualties based on vehicle types, road types, and accident severity.

## Key Features

- **Total Casualties**: Displays the total casualties for the current year (CY) and the percentage change compared to the previous year (YoY growth).
- **Total Accidents**: Shows the total number of accidents in the current year along with YoY comparison.
- **Fatal, Serious, and Slight Casualties**: Provides detailed breakdowns of casualties based on severity levels.
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Visualizes casualties grouped by vehicle type, including cars, bikes, buses, and more.
- **Casualties by Urban/Rural Areas**: Compares casualties in urban vs rural settings.
- **Casualties by Road Type**: Illustrates the distribution of casualties by different road types (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway).
- **Casualties by Light Condition**: Highlights the casualties occurring during the day versus at night.
- **Location Map**: A geographical map showing the exact locations of the accidents in the UK.

## Data Insights

1. **Primary KPIs**:
   - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for the current year and YoY growth.
   - Casualties by Accident Severity for both the current year and YoY growth.
   
2. **Secondary KPIs**:
   - Casualties by Vehicle Type for the current year.
   - Monthly trends for comparing casualties between the current year and the previous year.

## Visuals Included

1. **CY Casualties**: Showcases the total number of casualties in the current year, with a line chart comparing monthly data between 2021 and 2022.
2. **Casualties by Urban/Rural Areas**: A pie chart displaying the ratio of urban vs. rural casualties.
3. **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Lists vehicle types involved in accidents, with specific casualty counts for each.
4. **Casualties by Road Type**: A bar chart showing the number of casualties based on different types of roads (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway).
5. **Location Map**: A map pinpointing the locations of road accidents across the UK.
