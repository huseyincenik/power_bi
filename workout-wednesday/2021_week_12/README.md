Below is an example report illustrating the sorting challenge:

> **Note:** The bottom left bar chart title states "Sort by Total Units," but it should be "Forced Sort" following the specified order: **Rural, Urban, Mix, Youth**.

## Requirements
To complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Connect** to the **Sales & Marketing sample data** available on [PowerBI.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/).

   - **Second bar chart**: Sort using a custom field that ranks categories in the order:  
     **Rural â†’ Urban â†’ Mix â†’ Youth**.
3. Create a **bar chart** showing **Sales $ by Segment** and sort it by **Category (descending alphabetically).**
