Welcome to my solution for the **Workout Wednesday 2021 Week 3** challenge! This repository showcases my approach to adding slicers and interactivity to a basic KPI report in Power BI.

## Challenge Overview

This week's challenge builds on the data model from Week 1 and the basic KPI report created in Week 2. The focus is on enhancing the report by incorporating a slicer and increasing interactivity.

### Requirements:
1. **Add a Slicer:**
   - Add a slicer for **[Year]** to the report.
   - Edit interactions so the slicer only affects the KPIs and bar charts, not the trend lines.

2. **Enhance Interactivity:**
   - Edit interactions for the conference breakdowns so that they filter the KPIs and trends upon click.
   - Use colors to differentiate between the different metrics.

3. **Analysis Task:**
   - Determine how much money the MAC conference made in 2016.

### Dataset:
- The dataset used for this challenge is the same as in Week 1, focusing on NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues by year. It can be accessed [here](https://data.world/jbaucke/2021-w1-power-bi-wow-ncaa-financials).

## Solution

The solution includes:
- A **Year** slicer added to the report with interactions configured as specified.
- Enhanced interactivity in the report, allowing users to filter KPIs and trends by conference.
- Analysis of the MAC conference's earnings in 2016.

Thank you for checking out my solution. I hope it helps you with your own Power BI projects!
