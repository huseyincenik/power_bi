Welcome to my solution for the **Workout Wednesday 2021 Week 1** challenge! This repository showcases my approach to the first Power BI challenge of the year, which focuses on connecting to and modeling data.

## Challenge Overview

This week's challenge involves working with a dataset related to NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues. The goal is to clean the dataset and create an efficient data model in Power BI.

### Requirements:
1. **Clean the Data:**
   - Filter the dataset to include only Football Bowl Division teams.
   - Exclude FBA Totals and null values in the FBS Conferences field.
   - Remove Conference Medians from the NCAA Subdivision field.

2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Properly relate two dimension tables to the fact table.
   - Minimize the number of steps used in the process.

### Dataset:
- The dataset used for this challenge is available [here](https://data.world/jbaucke/2021-w1-power-bi-wow-ncaa-financials) and includes information on NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues by year.

## Solution

The solution includes:
- A cleaned dataset with the specified filters applied.
- A Power BI data model that efficiently relates dimension tables to the fact table.

Thank you for checking out my solution. I hope it helps you with your own Power BI projects!
