Welcome to my solution for the **Workout Wednesday 2021 Week 2** challenge! This repository showcases my approach to creating a basic KPI report in Power BI.

## Challenge Overview

This week's challenge builds on the data model created in Week 1. The goal is to develop a basic KPI dashboard that effectively presents key performance indicators using the provided NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues dataset.

### Requirements:
1. **Create Total Profits Field:**
   - Use Power Query (M) to create a new field called **Total Profits**.
   - **Total Profits** is calculated by subtracting **Total Expenses** from **Total Revenues** and then adding back **Excess Transfers Back**.
   - This adjustment accounts for recent NCAA policy changes, ensuring a more accurate reflection of the total profits generated by athletic departments.

2. **KPI Dashboard:**
   - Create a KPI dashboard that includes three high-level measures: **Total Revenues**, **Total Expenses**, and **Total Profits**.
   - The dashboard must include trend lines for each category and a breakdown by conference.
   - Indicate that this view is the "Summary level" within the header area.
   - The colors and design of the header section are at your discretion.

### Dataset:
- The dataset used for this challenge is the same as in Week 1, focusing on NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues by year. It can be accessed [here](https://data.world/jbaucke/2021-w1-power-bi-wow-ncaa-financials).

## Solution

The solution includes:
- A **Total Profits** field created in Power Query (M).
- A Power BI KPI dashboard that effectively visualizes key financial metrics with trend lines and conference breakdowns.
- A well-designed header section indicating the Summary level view.

Thank you for checking out my solution. I hope it helps you with your own Power BI projects!
